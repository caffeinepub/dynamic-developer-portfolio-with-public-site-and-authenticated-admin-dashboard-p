  "summary": "The diff adds a new /create route and navigation link, updates route-aware SEO for /create, and adds /create to the static sitemap. A new CreatePage component is added with a hero section and services section plus a primary CTA to /contact. However, the diff summary is truncated for CreatePage, so required “Featured Work” and “Advertisements” sections cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence. Several other unrelated frontend changes are indicated by the file summary list but were not requested.",
